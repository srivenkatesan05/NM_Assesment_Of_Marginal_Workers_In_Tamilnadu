DESCRIPTION :
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive socioeconomic analysis focusing on
marginal workers. The study will delve into the demographic attributes of this vital
workforce, including age, industrial categorization, and gender distribution. To
facilitate a clear understanding, visualizations in the form of bar charts, pie charts, and
heat maps will be employed to depict the distribution across these distinct categories.
In this project, we will outline the problem statement, the steps involved in solving it,
and the design thinking approach that will guide our project.
