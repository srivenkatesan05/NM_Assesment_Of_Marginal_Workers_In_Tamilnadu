The NM_DAC_Assessment_of_Marginal_Workers_in_Tamilnadu Repository emphasis the project which is given by the IBM organization as a Naan Mudhalvan. Which is developed and employed by a team of four members.

USE CASE NAME : Assesment of Marginal Workers in Tamilnadu

PROBLEM STATEMENT Use data analytics to analyse the demographic characteristics of marginal workers based on age, industrial category, and sex, create visualization such as bar charts, pie charts, or heatmaps to represent 
                  the distribution across different categories

Team Members are Gobikrishnan P, Aravind D, Arun S, Harsan M, Sri Venkatesan P
 
The objective of the problem statement is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the Marginal workers and visualize it.

DESIGN THINKING PROCESS Data Collection --> Data Pre-processing --> Model Selection And Training --> Visualization

The project is developed as 5 phases were all of the documentations were completed and uploaded in this repositary.

PHASE 1 In phase 1 the problem statement is defined detailly and the design thinking process is employed.

PHASE 2 In phase 2 the design thinking process is ecplained detailly and provided a detailed images visulations of this phase

PHASE 3 In phase 3 the dataset is pre-processed and it was ready to make analysis part.

PHASE 4 In phase 4 the analysis works were done and the visualization created in the IBM Cognos Platform and two dashboards were implemented.

PHASE 5 In phase 5 the overall project is integrated as a single document and submiited in the skillup portal.
